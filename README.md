File Browser
============

Shows a hierarchy of documents, based on the slashes in their filenames.

This is a plugin for Overview. You can see it live on
https://www.overviewdocs.com. [overview-local](https://github.com/overview/overview-local)
includes it automatically.

Development
===========

Setup
-----

1. Download and run [Overview](https://github.com/overview/overview-server.git)'s
   `./dev`. This creates the `overviewserver_default` Docker network that this
   plugin depends on in development mode.
1. In a separate console, `git clone https://github.com/overview/overview-file-browser.git`
1. `cd overview-file-browser`
1. `./gulp dev` starts a server that listens on http://localhost:3334
1. Test it within Overview:
    1. Browse to http://localhost:9000
    1. Upload files by using the "Add files in folder" button
    1. In the resulting Document Set, click "Add View" ... "Custom"
    1. Set `Name`: `Folders`, `App URL`: `http://localhost:3334`, and
       `Overviewâ€™s URL from App server`: `http://overview-web`

Development Loop
----------------

1. Run `./integration-tests/run` to make sure integration tests work. (You must
   be running Overview's `./dev` _and_ `./gulp dev` for integration tests to
   pass.
1. Run `./npm test` to make sure unit tests work. (You can also use
   `./npm run test-forever` to test every time a file changes.)
1. Write a new test; write accompanying code; make sure tests pass.

BUG: right now, when you edit `./server.js`, the web server in `./gulp dev`
won't reload your new code. Workaround: Ctrl+C and start it again.

Deploying
---------

Run `./release 1.0.1`. This will:

* Modify `package.json` to have the new version number
* Tag and push `v1.0.1` to GitHub
* `docker build . -t overview/overview-file-browser:1.0.1` and push the change

TODO: deploy automatically, via Jenkins

Now update your deployed cluster (e.g., ECS) to use the new version.
